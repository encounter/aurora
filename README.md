Aurora is a source-level GameCube & Wii compatibility layer intended for use with game decompilation projects.

Originally developed for use in [Metaforce](https://github.com/AxioDL/metaforce), a Metroid Prime reverse engineering project.
It now powers several completed source ports, including [Dusk](https://github.com/TwilitRealm/dusk).

### Graphics

The GX compatibility layer is built on top of [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/), a cross-platform graphics API
abstraction layer. WebGPU allows targeting all major platforms simultaneously with minimal overhead. The WebGPU
implementation used is Chromium's [Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/).
